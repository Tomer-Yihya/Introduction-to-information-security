The vulnerability is that we can tell what the cookie will be.

During a successful login we will simply set the cookie to be an encoding of the username - "edwrd".
After we have set the cookie, there is a link back to the login page which will cause login verification and we will be able to browse the site.
In our case we can simply change the cookie file to "edward" coding and then after refreshing it will see the correct cookie and we can browse the site as well.
