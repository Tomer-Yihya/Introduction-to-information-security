As we saw in the recitation, the function saves the array on the stack 
with the address arr[0] at the lowest address and arr[leng-1] at the highest.
We also saw that immediately after saving the array variables, we store the int variables.
in our case the 'auth' variable is saved immediately after the array.
There for the weakness is that the last character we send overrides 'auth' in the stack, 
so if we write in the last place the character from place [1] we will get that the condition will always be true (auth == 1) 
regardless of whether the password is correct or not
