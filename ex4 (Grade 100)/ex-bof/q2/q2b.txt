First I ran the command "python3 q2a.py" which causes the core to be dumped and the creation of the core file (the asm file is empty).
Then by running the commands:
- "sudo ./q2a.py core"
- "info registers"
- "x/28x ($esp -84)" (to find out the beginning of the array)
- "x/28x ($esp -64)" (to find out the place of the crash)
We discovered that the crash occurred when we read the value 0x68676767 located at address 0xbffffdfc 
i.e. this is the return address (which we will overwrite later).
We also found that the beginning of the buffer is at address 0xbffffdfb9.
Now we can know the size of the array by subtracting the addresses (0xbffffdfc-0xbffffdfb9 = 0x43 = 67).

In the Python file we simply copied the contents of the asm file and after that we filled in nops 
until we get to the return address where we wrote the address for the beginning of the array.
