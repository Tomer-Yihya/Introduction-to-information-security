Step 1:
In the core file I saw that the seg fault was at 0x72727271 in check_password().

Step 2:
Using "info registers" I figured out it is the value of EIP.

Step 3:
Using "x/48x ($esp - 130)"  -
Buffer start (X) = 0xbfffdff9
Address we want to change (A) = 0xbfffe03c
Offset (Y) = 67

In python:
Created the password from the shellcode bytes + padding to Y + X 
Ran the sudo program with the password and a random command(ls)
