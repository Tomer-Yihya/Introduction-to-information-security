I followed the instructions so the password composition is:
- 135 bytes of the character 'b' to fill the buffers	 (fill the buffers)
- POP EBP         		        		 (part of "puts into EBP")
- PUTS address	  		        		 (part of "puts into EBP")
- PUTS address	  		         		 ("jump to puts")
- ADD ESP, 4	  		        		 ("skip 4 bytes")
- string address (string = 'Take me...')		 (the "string address")
- POP ESP         		        		 (part of "jump to puts")
- PUTS address						     (part of "jump to puts")
- "POP EBP" address					     (part of "jump to puts")
- the string 'Take me..' in bytes
