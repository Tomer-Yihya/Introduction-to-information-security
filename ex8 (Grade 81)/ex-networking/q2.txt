When arrived an HTTP packet we check if its contain: "Host: infosec.cs.tau.ac.il" 
to detect a login attempt to the site.
If it is login attempt we inject our packet and otherwise we return 0.

Injected packet:
in the IP layer we switch the destination and source IPs from the packet we sniffed. 
in the TCP layer we switch the destination and source ports of the sniffed packet and sets the flags as AF (send an ACK and close the connection). 
I also set seq and ack to the required values and the Data filed was given.
