python:
I used q1.py and the gdb debuger to find the buffer start and end address, EIP address and all the functions address.
After that i can calculate the buffer size (1024), the offset from the buffer to the return address(16) and the total size (1040).
I added a nops to (1040 - shellcode size) bytes long and overwrite the EIP register with the buffer start address and the shellcode.

assembly:
- Create a socket
- Connect it to IP address 127.0.0.1 and port 1337.
- Redirects MYSOCKET file descriptors of STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR by useing dup2.
- create a shell by run execv with paht and NULL arguments.
