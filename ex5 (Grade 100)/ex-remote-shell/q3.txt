encode func: 
for every byte we check if it's valid ASCII (<=0x80), 
every byte that it's ASCII is not valid we xor it with mask (0xFF) 
otherwise the byte left unchange.

get_decoder_code func:
i xored each indices byte with 0xff.
then i calculate the distance form the last index and the number of times 
we increased ecx in order to get the offset difference.


get_ascii shellcode func: 
i used the method "PUSH and POP" in order to found the right address. 
then i subtract shellcode_length + 4 from EAX to get the start byte of the shellcode.
and finally i use encode and get_decoder_code functions.


get_payload func:
same as q2 but this time i fill the slide with x67 (CMP) insted of x90 (NOP). 
because NOP ASCII value is x90 which is not valid ASCII.
