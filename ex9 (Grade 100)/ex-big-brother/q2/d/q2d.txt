Winston:
- First I calcuate how many bits long is the original msg.
- Then I padd with '\0\0'. This will add 16 zeroes so the new reminder will be 0 
and also it won't affect the original msg.
(Now the msg is a multiple of 3 bits).
- Then I do "msg AND 7" (AND with 111) and shift (right) our msg 3 bits.
(To get each triplet).
- Finally I create the SA packet with the 3 bits in reserved and send it.


Julia:
- initilize defult packet in case we didn't get any packets.
- initilize triplets = -1.
- Sniffs all packets.
- Checks if they are TCP packets with sport=6500 and dport=1984.
- For every packet we got based on the seq value we add it to packets_from_winston.
- when got all the pacets I reassemble the msg.
