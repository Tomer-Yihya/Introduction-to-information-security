The vulnrability of this firewall is that we have a specifin sliding time window. 
The firewall blocks some IP only if it's sends 15 SYN packets in a 60sec time window. 
An a potitional attacker can add delay between the packets so it will send in 
less then 15 SYN packets a minute so he could keep sending SYN packets forever and never get blocked.
