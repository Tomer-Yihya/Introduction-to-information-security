generate_block_command:
return "sudo iptables -A INPUT -s <IP_ADDRESS> -j DROP"

on_packet:
- Save the timestamp.
- Check if it is a TCP packet.
- Then heck if the IP is blocked (if so ignore it).
- Add the timestamp to our dictionary.
- Create new list and take from the IP timestamp list only the relenant. SYN packets, at the end 
  we save the new list as the IP timestamp list.
- finally check If we have 15 or more SYN packets, if so we block this IP.
