The function generate_syn_packets:
Created packets with the destination IP as the input IP and dport as the input ports.

The function analyze_scan:
If packet is unanswered then we filter it.
If the packet is getting an answer, I check If flags == 'SA' 
if so it's mean that it is open (else it is closed).
    
Why is this called a stealth SYN scan:
- "stealth" because it is designed to be discreet and avoid detection by firewall systems.
- "SYN" is short for "synchronize." It is a flag used in the three-way handshake process in the TCP communication protocol.
- "Scan" is in the context of network security, a scan refers to the act of network to gather information about open ports, 
services, and potential vulnerabilities.

combined, "stealth SYN scan" refers to a scanning technique that sends SYN packets to specific ports 
on a target system without completing the full three-way handshake process. 
Instead of sending the final ACK packet to establish a connection, 
the scanning tool immediately terminates the connection after receiving the SYN-ACK response from the target system.

The purpose of this technique is to determine if a port is open (listening) or closed (not listening) 
without arousing suspicion or triggering security measures. 
By not completing the handshake, the scanning tool avoids creating a full connection, 
which could be logged by intrusion detection systems or firewall rules, potentially alerting the system administrators or triggering countermeasures.
