the code key idea:
This code gets as an input of two strings and concatenates them.

_LABEL1 code:
get the EDI pointer to the end of the string (like while loop) 

_LABEL2 code:
copy byte from ESI to EDI until copy all the source string




the code with notes:

   XOR EDX, EDX     # EDX = 0
_LABEL1:
   CMP [EDI], DL    # cheak if the pointer point to nothing
   JZ  _LABEL2      # if it does go to _LABEL2
   INC EDI          # promote the pointer by 1
   JMP _LABAL1      # go to _LABEL1

_LABEL2
   MOV AL, [ESI]    # copy byte from source to AL
   MOV [EDI], AL    # copy byte from AL to destination next place
   INC ESI          # promote the ESI pointer by 1
   INC EDI          # promote the EDI pointer by 1
   CMP AL, DL       
   JNZ _LABEL2      # IF(AL != DL) go to LABEL2

_END:

registers:
AL - 8 bits register
DL - 8 bits register
ESI - is for source (POINTER)
EDI - is for destination (POINTER)
