I just send a string with 2 commands keys and get different behaviors for Alice and for Bob.

The differens  is:
1) Alice:
Alice using json.load(), she only get the second command key ('echo cool'), 
in this case we know the signature, and after sending it we will pass Alice test.

2) Bob:
Bob doesn't use json.load(), he reads the file and looks for command, 
he find the first command ('echo hacked') and excute it (because we alredy passed Alice test).
