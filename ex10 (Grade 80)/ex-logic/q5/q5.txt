Alice reads the original file and validate it, right after that we change it to our command.

The Algiritham:
- Creating a proper file that passes the test
- executing run.py with the file who passes the test
- Wait 2 seconds for Alice to read the file we created
- Change the file to the malicious file
- Wait (25 seconds) until run.py will finish running
