The C code:
- Fork - Make the malware stop waiting for our output by forking a child process
- Attach to antivirus process
- Wait
- Infinite while loop:
1) catch all the system calls
2) check if it is a read syscall: 
     a)  if it's not - continue, 
     b) else puts -1 in the eax register 
	(the prosses thinks the read syscall has failed).
3) let the syscall finish
4) Wait for the next syscall
